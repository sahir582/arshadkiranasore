Dimensions: 800x400 pixels.
Action: Test the URL. If broken, create a new banner in Canva (grocery-themed, 800x400) or download a royalty-free image from Unsplash/Pexels. Optionally, save as images/promo.png and update index.html to <img src="images/promo.png" ...>.


Quality Products Icon (services section):

URL: https://template.canva.com/EAFbCS-9WbQ/2/0/1600w-5HPNn8Zx6oU.jpg
Dimensions: 64x64 pixels.

Fast Delivery Icon (services section):

URL: https://i.imgur.com/WMW8Bts.png

Favicon:

Create a 32x32 pixel favicon using Favicon.io or Canva (e.g., store logo or grocery icon).
Save as favicon.png in the root directory.



Note: If any image URL is broken, replace it with a local image by creating an images/ folder, adding the image, and updating the src attribute in index.html (e.g., src="images/promo.png").
Deployment on GitHub Pages

Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g., arshad-kirana-store).
Add index.html and favicon.png to the root directory. If using local images, create an images/ folder and add the images listed above.
Push to GitHub:git init
git add index.html favicon.png README.md [images/]
git commit -m "Restore original landing page with Tailwind CDN"
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
git push -u origin main


Enable GitHub Pages:
Go to Settings > Pages in your repository.
Select the main branch as the source and save.
The site will be live at https://<your-username>.github.io/arshad-kirana-store.


Test the site:
Verify the navbar is fixed at the top (fixed w-full z-10 top-0).
Check that all images load correctly (no placeholders like via.placeholder.com should appear).
Test the contact form (note: the original form uses basic JavaScript validation; consider Formspree for real submissions).



Adding Formspree (Optional)
The original contact form uses a simple alert-based JavaScript function. For real form submissions:

Sign up at https://formspree.io/ and create a form.
Replace the <div class="space-y-4">...</div> in the contact section with:<form id="contact-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id" method="POST" class="space-y-4">
    <div>
        <label for="name" class="block text-sm font-heading font-medium text-gray-700">Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="name" name="name" class="mt-1 block w-full border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm focus:ring-red-500 focus:border-red-500" placeholder="Your Name" required>
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="email" class="block text-sm font-heading font-medium text-gray-700">Email</label>
        <input type="email" id="email" name="email" class="mt-1 block w-full border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm focus:ring-red-500 focus:border-red-500" placeholder="Your Email" required>
    </div>
    <div>
        <label for="message" class="block text-sm font-heading font-medium text-gray-700">Message</label>
        <textarea id="message" name="message" rows="4" class="mt-1 block w-full border-gray-300 rounded-md shadow-sm focus:ring-red-500 focus:border-red-500" placeholder="Your Message" required></textarea>
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="w-full bg-red-500 text-white font-heading font-semibold py-2 px-4 rounded-full hover:bg-red-600 transition">Send Message</button>
</form>


Add this script before </body>:<script>
    document.getElementById('contact-form').addEventListener('submit', async function(event) {
        event.preventDefault();
        const form = event.target;
        const formData = new FormData(form);
        try {
            const response = await fetch(form.action, {
                method: form.method,
                body: formData,
                headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' }
            });
            if (response.ok) {
                alert('Message sent successfully!');
                form.reset();
            } else {
                alert('There was an error sending your message. Please try again.');
            }
        } catch (error) {
            alert('There was an error sending your message. Please try again.');
        }
    });
</script>


Replace your-form-id with your Formspree form ID.

Notes

Navbar: The navbar is fixed at the top as in your original code (fixed w-full z-10 top-0). The pt-16 in the image-box section prevents content overlap.
Images: Test all image URLs in a browser. If any fail to load (e.g., the Canva banner), create/download replacements and either update index.html with new URLs or use local images in an images/ folder. Use Canva, Flaticon, or Unsplash for replacements.
Tailwind CDN: Kept as <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script> per your original code. For production, consider a local Tailwind build to optimize performance (I can guide you if needed).
Testing: After deployment, check that all images load and the navbar stays fixed. If any image shows a placeholder, replace it with a local version.
Form: The original form is restored with the submitForm() function. Consider Formspree for real submissions as outlined above.

If you confirm which image was missing or need help creating specific images, I can provide more targeted assistance. Let me know if you want to switch to local images or add Formspree!
